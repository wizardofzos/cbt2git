03/22/94 - LOAD MODULE ON FILE 035 WAS COMPILED WITH PL/1 OPTIMIZER
           VERSION 1.3.  THEREFORE IT WILL RUN WITH THAT TRANSIENT
           LIBRARY AND ANYTHING HIGHER.  IT IS TO OUR ADVANTAGE TO
           HAVE THIS OLD ASMTOZAP LOAD MODULE, FOR SHOPS WHICH HAVEN'T
           BOUGHT NEWER VERSIONS OF THE PL/1 TRANSIENT LIBRARY.

08/04/13 - GERHARD POSTPISCHIL MADE A REWORK OF ASMTOZAP IN ASSEMBLER.
           I HAVE CALLED IT ASMTOZAG IN THIS PDS.  ASMTOZAG NEEDS THE
           MEMBER SUBLPALK TO BE ASSEMBLED ALONG WITH IT, AND IT NEEDS
           33 MACROS (MEMBER ASMTOMAC) TO ASSEMBLE CLEANLY.  THE ENTIRE
           JOB HAS BEEN PACKAGED AS MEMBER ASMTOZA$ (ASSEMBLY-LINKEDIT
           JCL).  I MYSELF HAVEN'T TESTED IT, SO I CAN'T VOUCH FOR IT.
           BUT IT'S PRESENTED HERE FOR YOU TO TRY.  ORIGINAL MATERIALS
           CAME FROM CBT FILES 860 AND 861.
