//*  NOTE.    THIS PROGRAM IS WRITTEN IN PL/1.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE    *   FILE 044
//*           TRIED TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR ALL MVS SHOPS TO USE    *   FILE 044
//*           ASMTOZAP.  FIRST, THERE IS A VERSION THAT RUNS        *   FILE 044
//*           UNDER PL1/F - THE FREE VERSION OF PL/1 WHOSE          *   FILE 044
//*           COMPILER AND LIBRARY IS ON THIS TAPE - FILE 092.      *   FILE 044
//*           SECOND, THE LOAD MODULE FOR ASMTOZAP THAT IS ON       *   FILE 044
//*           FILE 035 IS AN OLD LOAD MODULE THAT WAS COMPILED      *   FILE 044
//*           USING THE PL/1 OPTIMIZER VERSION 1.3.0.  THEREFORE    *   FILE 044
//*           YOU CAN RUN THAT MODULE, EVEN ON A VERY OLD VERSION   *   FILE 044
//*           OF THE PL/1 OPTIMIZER TRANSIENT LIBRARY.  (AND OF     *   FILE 044
//*           COURSE YOU CAN RUN IT ON THE NEWER VERSIONS           *   FILE 044
//*           OF PL/1.)                 SG - 03/22/94               *   FILE 044

//*           Gerhard Postpischil made a rework of ASMTOZAP in      *   FILE 044
//*           Assembler.  I have called it ASMTOZAG in this pds.    *   FILE 044
//*           ASMTOZAG needs the member SUBLPALK to be assembled    *   FILE 044
//*           along with it, and it needs 33 macros (member         *   FILE 044
//*           ASMTOMAC) to assemble cleanly.  The entire job has    *   FILE 044
//*           been packaged as member ASMTOZA$ (Assembly-Linkedit   *   FILE 044
//*           JCL).  I myself haven't tested it, so I can't vouch   *   FILE 044
//*           for it.  But it's presented here for you to try.      *   FILE 044
